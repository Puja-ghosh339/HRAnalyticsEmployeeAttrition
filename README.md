🚀 Unveiling My IBM HR Analytics Project! 📊

I’m thrilled to share my latest data analysis journey—IBM HR Analytics, a comprehensive project designed to explore trends, uncover insights, and drive data-driven decisions in HR management. This was an enriching experience where I delved deep into employee data, creating actionable visualizations to tackle real-world HR challenges like attrition, job satisfaction, and compensation trends.
